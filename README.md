# Js Quiz
# Discription
 AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peer. I tried to use functions and method that helps me to creat a timed quiz like loping throu an array of objects us the DOM to get my quiz iteractif.

Given I am taking a code quiz
If I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question
If I answer a question, I am presented with another question
If I answer a question incorrectly,time is subtracted from the clock
If all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over
If the game is over, I can save my initials and my score
